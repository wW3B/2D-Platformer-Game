# 🎮 2D Platformer Game (Mario-like)

A simple 2D side-scroll platformer game inspired by classic Mario-style gameplay.  
The game is built using **Java** and the **LibGDX game framework**, showcasing core mechanics such as movement, collision detection, scoring, and health management.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** LibGDX  
- **Tools:** Gradle, LibGDX Game Libraries

---

## 🚀 Game Features
- Player movement and jumping  
- Basic enemy obstacles  
- Scoring system (collect points)  
- Breakable blocks and item interaction  
- Health system (damage, heal, game over)

## 📌 How It Works

Launch the game on Desktop (Java + LibGDX)

Player can move and jump through obstacles

Collect items to gain score

Player loses health when hitting obstacles

Game over when health reaches zero

## ▶️ Running the Game (Desktop)

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/wW3B/2D-Platformer-Game.git
```
```
Open project in your IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse)

Run the desktop launcher class

DesktopLauncher.java
```

Enjoy the game!

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
